## 5. Model Insights

### 5.1 Why N-BEATS Performed Best
1. **Decomposition**: Separates trend from noise effectively
2. **Non-linear patterns**: Captures complex market dynamics
3. **Robust to overfitting**: Simpler architecture than TFT
4. **Interpretable**: Clear separation of components

### 5.2 Direction Accuracy Analysis
- **TFT & N-BEATS**: 100% direction accuracy
- This means they correctly predict whether a sector will outperform or underperform SPY
- Critical for long/short strategies

### 5.3 Risk Considerations
- R² values are negative for some models, indicating high variance
- Small validation set (19 days) may affect reliability
- Market regime changes could impact predictions
