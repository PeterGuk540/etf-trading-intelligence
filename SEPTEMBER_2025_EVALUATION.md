EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This report evaluates the ETF Trading Intelligence System's ensemble
predictions for September 2025 against actual market performance.

Evaluation Period: September 1-30, 2025 (21 trading days)
Prediction Horizon: 21-day forward relative returns (ETF return - SPY return)
Number of ETFs: 11 major sector ETFs
Model Used: 4-Model Ensemble with Sector-Specific Weighting

ENSEMBLE MODEL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------
ðŸ”— ENSEMBLE Model Architecture:
  â€¢ 4 Neural Network Models with Adaptive Weighted Averaging:
    - LSTM (Baseline): Best for XLK (Technology) - 57.1% validation accuracy
    - TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer): Best for XLF (Financials) - 50.8% validation accuracy
    - N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion): General purpose forecasting
    - LSTM-GARCH (Hybrid): Best for XLE (Energy) - 77.8% validation accuracy

  â€¢ Ensemble Methodology: Multi-Level Weighted Averaging
    Level 1 - Sector-Specific Base Weights:
      XLE: LSTM-GARCH 70%, LSTM 20%, TFT 10%, N-BEATS 0%
      XLK: LSTM 60%, N-BEATS 30%, TFT 10%, LSTM-GARCH 0%
      XLF: TFT 50%, LSTM 30%, N-BEATS 20%, LSTM-GARCH 0%
      Others: LSTM 30%, TFT 30%, N-BEATS 20%, LSTM-GARCH 20%

    Level 2 - VIX Regime Adjustments (21-day lagged):
      LOW_VOL: LSTM Ã—1.2, TFT Ã—1.1, N-BEATS Ã—1.0, LSTM-GARCH Ã—0.8
      MEDIUM_VOL: All models Ã—1.0 (no adjustment)
      HIGH_VOL: LSTM Ã—0.8, TFT Ã—0.9, N-BEATS Ã—1.0, LSTM-GARCH Ã—1.3

    Level 3 - Final Weighted Average:
      ensemble_pred = Î£(normalized_weight[i] Ã— model_pred[i])

  â€¢ Uncertainty Quantification: Standard deviation of model predictions

Features Used (206 per ETF):
  â€¢ 20 Alpha Factors: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, momentum, volatility
  â€¢ 186 Beta Factors: 62 FRED economic indicators with 3 variations
  â€¢ Cross-sectional features: Sector relative performance metrics

Model Training Methodology:
  â€¢ Training Period: January 2020 - July 2025 (single continuous period)
  â€¢ Validation Period: August 2025 (single month, 45.5% direction accuracy)
  â€¢ Prediction Made: End of August 2025 for September 2025
  â€¢ Note: Rolling window validation used for model selection, but final predictions
    used single training period for consistency
