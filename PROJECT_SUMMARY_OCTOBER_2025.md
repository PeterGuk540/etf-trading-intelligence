# ETF Trading Intelligence System - Complete Project Summary
**Date: October 6, 2025**

## Executive Overview

The ETF Trading Intelligence System is a Python-based quantitative trading platform designed to predict monthly sector rotation patterns across 11 major ETF sectors. After comprehensive re-execution and validation of all components, this report provides an accurate assessment of the system's actual capabilities, performance, and implementation status.

## What the System Actually Does

### Core Functionality
- **Predicts**: 21-day forward relative returns (ETF return - SPY return)
- **Coverage**: 11 sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLY, XLP, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC)
- **Features**: 206 per ETF (20 technical + 186 economic indicators)
- **Models**: 4 neural network architectures (LSTM, TFT, N-BEATS, LSTM-GARCH)
- **Output**: Buy/sell signals based on predicted outperformance vs SPY

### What It Doesn't Do (Despite Documentation Claims)
- No full Transformer architecture (TFT uses attention but isn't a full Transformer)
- No Graph Neural Networks
- âœ… **Ensemble integration**: COMPLETED - 4 models now combined with sector-specific weighting
- No real-time trading API
- No Docker deployment
- No advanced portfolio optimization

## Actual Performance Metrics

### Data Collection Results
```
âœ“ Market data: 1,699 days (2019-2025)
âœ… FRED indicators: 62/62 successful (ALL WORKING with robust retry/alternatives)
âœ“ Features generated: 206 per ETF Ã— 11 ETFs = 2,266 total
âœ“ Date range: 2019-04-02 to 2025-09-04
```

### Model Validation Performance
**Rolling Window Validation (Q4 2024 - Q3 2025):**

All 4 Models Tested:
1. **LSTM (Baseline)**: 48.1% direction accuracy, -7.28 RÂ²
2. **TFT (Attention)**: 44.4% direction accuracy, -4.25 RÂ² (best RÂ²)
3. **N-BEATS**: 48.1% direction accuracy, -17.20 RÂ²
4. **LSTM-GARCH**: 47.6% direction accuracy, -25.40 RÂ²
