# ETF Trading Intelligence System

A Python-based ETF sector rotation prediction system using an ensemble of 4 neural network architectures to forecast monthly relative returns across 11 major sector ETFs.

## üìä System Overview

This system predicts 21-day forward relative returns (ETF return - SPY return) for sector rotation strategies. It uses 219 features per ETF combining technical indicators, economic data, and VIX regime detection to train an ensemble of 4 neural network models with sector-specific weighting.

### Model Architectures
The system implements an ensemble of 4 neural network architectures with sector-specific weighting:

1. **LSTM (Baseline)**: 2-layer LSTM with 64 hidden units
   - Direction Accuracy: 48.1%
   - Best for: XLK (Technology) - 57.1% accuracy

2. **TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer)**: LSTM with multi-head attention
   - Direction Accuracy: 44.4%
   - Best for: XLF (Financials) - 50.8% accuracy

3. **N-BEATS**: Neural basis expansion analysis
   - Direction Accuracy: 48.1%
   - General purpose forecasting

4. **LSTM-GARCH**: LSTM with volatility modeling
   - Direction Accuracy: 47.6%
   - Best for: XLE (Energy) - 77.8% accuracy

### üîó Ensemble Methodology: Adaptive Weighted Averaging

The system uses a **sophisticated multi-level weighted averaging approach** (not simple averaging or bagging):

#### **Level 1: Sector-Specific Base Weights**
Each sector has optimized weights based on validation performance:
```
XLE (Energy):     LSTM-GARCH: 70%, LSTM: 20%, TFT: 10%, N-BEATS: 0%
XLK (Technology): LSTM: 60%, N-BEATS: 30%, TFT: 10%, LSTM-GARCH: 0%
XLF (Financials): TFT: 50%, LSTM: 30%, N-BEATS: 20%, LSTM-GARCH: 0%
Other Sectors:    LSTM: 30%, TFT: 30%, N-BEATS: 20%, LSTM-GARCH: 20%
```

#### **Level 2: VIX Regime Adjustments (21-day lagged)**
Base weights are multiplied by regime-specific factors:
- **LOW_VOL (VIX < 20)**: LSTM √ó1.2, TFT √ó1.1, N-BEATS √ó1.0, LSTM-GARCH √ó0.8
- **MEDIUM_VOL (20-30)**: All models √ó1.0 (no adjustment)
- **HIGH_VOL (VIX > 30)**: LSTM √ó0.8, TFT √ó0.9, N-BEATS √ó1.0, LSTM-GARCH √ó1.3

#### **Level 3: Final Ensemble Calculation**
```python
adjusted_weight = base_weight √ó vix_adjustment
normalized_weight = adjusted_weight / sum(all_adjusted_weights)
ensemble_prediction = Œ£(normalized_weight[i] √ó model_prediction[i])
uncertainty = std_deviation(all_model_predictions)
```

#### **Key Advantages**
- **Not simple averaging**: Dynamic weights based on performance and market conditions
- **Not bagging**: All models see full data, no bootstrap sampling
- **Sector-adaptive**: Optimized for each sector's characteristics
- **Regime-adaptive**: Adjusts to market volatility environment
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Model disagreement provides confidence intervals

## üìä Validation Methodology

The system employs two distinct approaches:

### Model Validation (Rolling Windows)
Used in `validate_all_models.py` for robust model selection:
- **Training Window**: 2 years (500+ samples)
- **Validation Window**: 3 months (60+ samples)
- **Step Size**: 3 months
- **Coverage**: Multiple market conditions from 2024-2025

### Production Predictions (Single Split)
Used in `etf_monthly_prediction_system.py` for actual predictions:
- **Training Period**: Jan 2020 to (current month - 2)
- **Validation Period**: (current month - 2) single month
- **Prediction Period**: Current month onwards
- **Note**: September 2025 predictions used Jan 2020 - July 2025 training

## üîç Key Insights

1. **Volatility is King**: Volatility measures are the strongest predictors
2. **Economic Matters**: Economic indicators (beta) contribute nearly 48% of predictive power
3. **Sector Specificity**: Each sector responds differently to economic drivers
4. **Direction > Magnitude**: Direction accuracy matters more than R¬≤ for trading profitability
