# ETF Trading Intelligence System

A Python-based ETF sector rotation prediction system using an ensemble of 4 neural network architectures to forecast monthly relative returns across 11 major sector ETFs.

## üìä System Overview

This system predicts 21-day forward relative returns (ETF return - SPY return) for sector rotation strategies. It uses 206 features per ETF combining technical indicators and economic data to train an ensemble of 4 neural network models with sector-specific weighting.

## üéØ Actual Performance

- **Average Direction Accuracy**: 48.1% across rolling windows
- **Average R¬≤**: -4.25 (negative due to noisy relative returns)
- **MAE**: 3.77%

### Real-World Performance (VIX Regime-Aware Ensemble - CORRECTED)
**September 2025 Results (Corrected Methodology):**
- **Direction Accuracy**: 72.7% (8/11 correct) - **HIGHEST ACHIEVED!**
- **Correlation**: 0.628 (strong positive correlation)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 2.92%

## üõ†Ô∏è Actual Implementation

### Features (217 per ETF) ‚úÖ WITH CORRECTED VIX REGIME DETECTION
- **20 Alpha Factors**: Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, momentum, volatility)
- **186 Beta Factors**: 62 FRED economic indicators with 3 variations each
- **11 VIX Regime Features**: **21-day lagged** Low/Medium/High volatility regime detection + VIX dynamics
- **Total**: 2,387 features across all 11 ETFs (217 √ó 11)
- **Data Quality**: 62/62 FRED indicators successfully fetched with robust retry/alternative logic
- **üîß CRITICAL**: All VIX regime features use 21-day lag to prevent data leakage

### Model Architectures
The system implements an ensemble of 4 neural network architectures with sector-specific weighting:

1. **LSTM (Baseline)**: 2-layer LSTM with 64 hidden units
   - Direction Accuracy: 48.1%
   - Best for: XLK (Technology) - 57.1% accuracy

2. **TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer)**: LSTM with multi-head attention
   - Direction Accuracy: 44.4%
   - Best for: XLF (Financials) - 50.8% accuracy

3. **N-BEATS**: Neural basis expansion analysis
   - Direction Accuracy: 48.1%
   - General purpose forecasting

4. **LSTM-GARCH**: LSTM with volatility modeling
   - Direction Accuracy: 47.6%
   - Best for: XLE (Energy) - 77.8% accuracy

### üîó Ensemble Methodology: Adaptive Weighted Averaging

The system uses a **sophisticated multi-level weighted averaging approach** (not simple averaging or bagging):

#### **Level 1: Sector-Specific Base Weights**
Each sector has optimized weights based on validation performance:
```
XLE (Energy):     LSTM-GARCH: 70%, LSTM: 20%, TFT: 10%, N-BEATS: 0%
XLK (Technology): LSTM: 60%, N-BEATS: 30%, TFT: 10%, LSTM-GARCH: 0%
XLF (Financials): TFT: 50%, LSTM: 30%, N-BEATS: 20%, LSTM-GARCH: 0%
Other Sectors:    LSTM: 30%, TFT: 30%, N-BEATS: 20%, LSTM-GARCH: 20%
```

#### **Level 2: VIX Regime Adjustments (21-day lagged)**
Base weights are multiplied by regime-specific factors:
- **LOW_VOL (VIX < 20)**: LSTM √ó1.2, TFT √ó1.1, N-BEATS √ó1.0, LSTM-GARCH √ó0.8
- **MEDIUM_VOL (20-30)**: All models √ó1.0 (no adjustment)
- **HIGH_VOL (VIX > 30)**: LSTM √ó0.8, TFT √ó0.9, N-BEATS √ó1.0, LSTM-GARCH √ó1.3

#### **Level 3: Final Ensemble Calculation**
```python
adjusted_weight = base_weight √ó vix_adjustment
normalized_weight = adjusted_weight / sum(all_adjusted_weights)
ensemble_prediction = Œ£(normalized_weight[i] √ó model_prediction[i])
uncertainty = std_deviation(all_model_predictions)
```

#### **Key Advantages**
- **Not simple averaging**: Dynamic weights based on performance and market conditions
- **Not bagging**: All models see full data, no bootstrap sampling
- **Sector-adaptive**: Optimized for each sector's characteristics
- **Regime-adaptive**: Adjusts to market volatility environment
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Model disagreement provides confidence intervals
